=>CDN- Content Delivery Network.
    Whenever a user to trying to access a webpage that is hosted in a server which
    is geographically far away from user, the webpage loading becomes slow.
    Inorder to tackle this situation, CDN servers are introduced, which is closer to user.
    This will help in faster webpage loading.
    Benefits of CDN
        Less page load time.
        Content is available even if one or more servers are offline, since data can be fetched from
        other CDN servers.
        Better web security as CDN servers can handle large requests and distribute among different CDN servers.
        This will help in preventing DDos attacks.

=>CDN and react
    <script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"  // used for importing React .js file
    ></script>
    <script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js" // used for ReactDOM file
    ></script>
    <script src="script.js"> </script>

    =>  This particular order should be maintained because it will show the error
        Uncaught ReferenceError: React is not defined
        at index.html:11:23
        index.html:30 Uncaught ReferenceError: ReactDOM is not defined
        at index.html:30:20

    =>  crossorigin in script tag
        Crossorigin attribute is used when a script on one domain is trying to fetch or interact with resources from another domain.
        Here we're are fetching CDN links of React.

=>React.createElement will create react element or javascript object
    React.createElement("div",{id:"container","Hello World"});
        first parameter    => div = tagName
        second parameter   =>{id:"container"} = attributes of tag
        third parameter    =>"Hello World" = Children or content inside tag
                             this can be array of react elements if we are nesting elements

=>ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))
  root.render(reactElement) will convert it to corresponding HTML equivalent.
